# Versioning and Branching Strategy

This document defines how the project handles versioning, branching, and the distinction between **package releases** and **website-only updates**.

## Overview

The repository contains two categories of content:

- **Packages** — `@storybook-astro/framework` and `@storybook-astro/renderer` in `packages/@storybook-astro/*`. These are published to npm and follow semantic versioning with a formal release process.
- **Website** — The Astro site at `src/`, `public/`, and root config files (`astro.config.mjs`, `wrangler.toml`). Deployed to [storybook-astro.org](https://storybook-astro.org) via CloudFlare. Website changes do **not** require a package release.

## Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (`x.0.0`) — Breaking API changes
- **Minor** (`0.x.0`) — New features, backward-compatible
- **Patch** (`0.0.x`) — Bug fixes, backward-compatible

During beta, versions use the format `0.x.y-beta.z` (e.g. `0.1.0-beta.1`). Pre-release versions are published to npm with the `beta` dist-tag.

Only the packages in `packages/@storybook-astro/*` are versioned and published. The website, stories, and root project config are not versioned separately.

## Branches

- **`main`** — Stable, deployable branch. Package releases are tagged here. Website deploys from here.
- **`develop`** — Integration branch for in-progress package work. Feature and fix PRs merge here first.
- **`feature/*`** — New features, branched from `develop` (e.g. `feature/vue-slots`).
- **`fix/*`** — Bug fixes, branched from `develop`.
- **`release/*`** — Release prep, branched from `develop` and merged to `main` when ready.

## Workflow: Package Changes (Releases)

Changes to anything under `packages/@storybook-astro/*` follow the full Gitflow process:

1. Branch from `develop` (e.g. `feature/container-api-update`)
2. Implement and test changes (`yarn test`, `yarn lint`)
3. Open a PR targeting `develop`
4. After review and merge, the change sits in `develop` until the next release

### Cutting a Release

1. Create `release/x.y.z` from `develop`
2. Bump versions in both package.json files
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Final testing (`yarn test`, `yarn lint`)
5. Merge to `main` and tag (e.g. `v0.1.0-beta.2`)
6. Publish to npm (renderer first, then framework):
   ```bash
   cd packages/@storybook-astro/renderer
   yarn npm publish --tag beta --access public
   cd ../framework
   yarn npm publish --tag beta --access public
   ```
7. Promote to `latest` dist-tag:
   ```bash
   npm dist-tag add @storybook-astro/renderer@x.y.z-beta.N latest
   npm dist-tag add @storybook-astro/framework@x.y.z-beta.N latest
   ```
8. Merge `main` back into `develop`

### Publishing: `yarn npm publish` vs `npm publish`

**Always use `yarn npm publish`, never raw `npm publish`.**

The framework package depends on the renderer via `"@storybook-astro/renderer": "workspace:*"`. Yarn Berry automatically resolves `workspace:*` to the actual version number at publish time. Raw `npm publish` does not understand the `workspace:` protocol and will publish it verbatim, causing install failures for consumers.

### Hotfixes

For critical bugs in a published release:

1. Branch from `main` as `fix/critical-bug`
2. Fix, test, bump patch version
3. Merge to both `main` and `develop`
4. Tag and publish with `yarn npm publish` (see publishing note above)

## Workflow: Website-Only Changes

Changes that only affect the website (`src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `src/styles/`, `src/content/`, `public/`, `astro.config.mjs`) do **not** go through the release process. These changes:

- Can be merged directly to `main` via PR
- Do not require a version bump or changelog entry
- Do not require an npm publish
- Are deployed automatically when `main` is updated (via CloudFlare)

### Examples of Website-Only Changes

- Updating page copy or styling
- Adding or editing docs pages
- Fixing layout or navigation bugs
- Updating the home page hero or feature grid
- Changing `astro.config.mjs` settings

### How to Identify Website-Only Changes

A PR is website-only if it touches **none** of the following:

- `packages/@storybook-astro/framework/**`
- `packages/@storybook-astro/renderer/**`
- Root config that affects packages (e.g. `tsconfig.json` workspace settings)

### Process

1. Branch from `main` (e.g. `website/update-hero`)
2. Make website changes
3. Open a PR targeting `main`
4. After review and merge, CloudFlare deploys automatically

## Mixed Changes

If a PR includes both package and website changes, it must follow the **package release workflow** (branch from `develop`, merge to `develop`, release to `main`). The website updates will deploy when the release is merged to `main`.

## Summary

| Change Type | Branch From | PR Target | Version Bump | npm Publish | Deploy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Package feature/fix | `develop` | `develop` | Yes (at release) | Yes | At release |
| Website-only | `main` | `main` | No | No | On merge |
| Hotfix | `main` | `main` + `develop` | Yes (patch) | Yes | On merge |
| Mixed | `develop` | `develop` | Yes (at release) | Yes | At release |
